# Learning C Programming 

This is some basic exercises to get familiar with C programming, and notes regarding features in the C programming language.

## Data Types

Data types:
* char - character (or single byte)
* short - short int
* long - long integer 
* double - double-precision floating point

**Note:** you can specify the accuracy (trailing decimals) in printf by using the float number followed by *f* 
ex. `printf("6.1f", 32.423232);`


*Long integer* - int (long integers) are at least 32 bits. On some systems, `int` and `long` are the same size.
